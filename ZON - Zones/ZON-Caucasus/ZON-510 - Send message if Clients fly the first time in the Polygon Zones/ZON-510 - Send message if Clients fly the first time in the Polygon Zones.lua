-- Name: ZON-510 - Send message if Clients fly the first time in the Polygon Zones
-- Author: Wingthor and FlightControl
-- Date Created: 20 January 2017
--
-- # Situation:
--
-- There are a couple of player slots of Su-25Ts, that need to fly through two poly zones. 
-- Once a player flies through a poly zone, a message will be sent. But only once. If he flies back through the same zone,
-- nothing is displayed anymore. Unless he logs off and rejoins the mission.
--
-- # Test cases:
-- 
-- 

-- MOOSE wraps each Group alive in the mission into a GROUP class object. The GROUP class object is a wrapper object, wrapping
-- the Group object from DCS and adding methods to it.
-- Get the GROUP wrapper objects that were created by MOOSE at mission startup, by using the GROUP:FindByName() method.
-- The Group name is the parameter to be searched for.
-- Note that late activated groups are also "alive" and have a corresponding GROUP object in the running mission.
PolyZoneGroup1 = GROUP:FindByName("PolyZone1")
PolyZoneGroup2 = GROUP:FindByName("PolyZone2")

-- Create 2 Polygon objects, using the ZONE_POLYGON:New constructor.
-- The first parameter gives a name to the zone, the second is the GROUP object that defines the zone form.
PolyZone1 = ZONE_POLYGON:New( "PolyZone1", PolyZoneGroup1 )
PolyZone2 = ZONE_POLYGON:New( "PolyZone2", PolyZoneGroup2 )

-- Create a SET of Moose CLIENT wrapper objects. At mission startup, a SET of Moose client wrapper objects is created.
-- Note that CLIENT objects don't necessarily need to be alive!!! 
-- So this set contains EVERY RED coalition client defined within the mission.
RedClients = SET_CLIENT:New():FilterCoalitions("red"):FilterStart()



RedClients:ForEachClient( 
  function( MooseClient )
  
    -- Here we register the state of the client in which step he is in.
    -- We set the state of the client "ZoneStep" to 0, indicating that he is not out of the first zone.
